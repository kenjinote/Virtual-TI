Virtual TI v2.5 beta 5
Written by Rusty Wagner

Requirements
* A Pentium or better running Windows 95 or higher,
  or Windows NT 4.0 or higher

This emulator will run ROMs from the TI-82, TI-83,
TI-83 Plus, TI-85, TI-86, TI-89, TI-92, TI-92 II,
and/or TI-92 Plus calculators.

A menu containing the functions of the emulator can
be obtained by right clicking on the LCD.

Features:
* ROM versions are automatically detected
* Switch between ROM versions without restarting the
  emulator
* Built-in ROM dumper with automatic error correction
* Archive memory support for TI-89 and TI-92 Plus
* Send files to the calculator
* Receive files from the virtual calculator
* Use a TI Graph-link cable or serial cable to connect to a
  real calculator
* Connect two instances of the emulator with a virtual
  link
* Sound emulation
* Save and load the state of the calculator.  Any
  changes to the Flash ROM (i.e. archived variables)
  will be included in the state.
* 4-level and 7-level grayscale support
* Full skinning system with editor
* Resize emulation window to any size
* Screenshot feature which saves to a BMP or to the
  clipboard
* Option to emulate at either the true speed of the
  calculator or the fastest the computer can handle.
* The letter keys are aliased to produce their
  respective letters.  No need to press the Alpha
  key, just type.
* A full-featured graphical debugger
    * Code disassembly pane.  ROM call addresses are
      replaced by the name of the ROM function.  DB92
      symbol information is also used when available.
    * Code breakpoints.  Does not modify memory, so
      they are completely transparent.
    * Data breakpoints can be set on a single byte,
      word, or dword, or a range of addresses.
    * Set a breakpoint on entry to an assembly program
      automatically.
    * View and change the value of the registers
    * Hexadecimal memory view/edit pane with search
      capability
    * On the 89/92(+), a handle pane which lists all
      allocated handles.  Allows user to jump directly
      to the start of the handle within either the
      disassembly pane or the memory pane.
    * On the 82-86, a variable pane which lists all
      variables and their types.  Allows user to jump
      directly to the start of the variable within
      either the dissassembly pane or the memory pane.
    * Real time updates to the LCD, even with grayscale
    * Log reads/writes to memory or changes to
      individual bits

Limitations of this beta 5 version:
* 8-level grayscale on the TI-86 doesn't work properly
  yet
* Key redefinition is not yet implemented, although the
  program should now work on international keyboards
  without it
* Receiving of backups from the virtual calculator is
  not implemented
* Log link port send/receive is not implemented
* TI-82 ROM dumper does not work

This emulator requires a ROM image from a real
calculator that you own.  I will not send you any ROMs.
You can use the built-in ROM dumper to obtain an image
from your calculator.

If you already have a ROM dump, place it in the same
directory as VTI.EXE (this is done automatically if you
use the built-in dumper).  Make sure it has the
extension .rom, .bin, or .dmp.  The file name may be
anything (the calculator and version number are
automatically detected).  Any .tib Flash ROM upgrades
will also be recognized if placed in the same directory
as VTI.EXE.  The latest version will be used by default,
but you may revert to an earlier version from the
emulation mode dialog.

To send a file to the calculator, press F10 or drag and
drop from explorer.
To enter the debugger, press F11.
To bring up the emulation ROM version screen, press F12.


The debugger is for the most part the same as any other
graphical debugger.  One thing to note is the color of
the lines in the disassembly pane.  Red means
breakpoint, green means current PC, and blue means
currently selected.  If a line is in more than one
state at the same time, the colors will be combined.
For example, a breakpoint that is selected will combine
red and blue, making magenta.  Also, pressing G in
either the disassembly or memory pane will allow you
to jump to a specific address.  Registers can be changed
by clicking on them.


The source code to the emulator can be found on the
Virtual TI web page at http://vti.acz.org, and requires
C++Builder 3 to compile.  You may use the 68K and Z80
emulation core and disassembler as long as you mention
its original source, the Multiple Arcade Machine
Emulator, and provide the address where one can obtain
the entire distribution (its web address is listed
below).  The JPEG encoding/decoding code is part of the
Colosseum Builders C++ Image Library.  Any of the other
code can be used as long as you state that it came from
this program.

You may not sell the binaries or source to this program.
They are free and will always be free.  This program
cannot be distributed with any copyrighted ROM images
(independently developed replacement operating systems
are OK).
